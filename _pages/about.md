My name is Tom Wu. I'm a PhD candidate at Boston University Department of Mechanical Engineering.
I'm a researcher with research interests at the intersection of optimization, control, robotics, and computer vision. I’m particularly drawn to applying mathematical tools—such as convex optimization and Riemannian geometry—to challenging problems in robot motion planning, visual perception, and automatic control.

### Recent Projects

- **Convex Optimization Framework:** Developed a framework for solving low-rank semidefinite programs (SDPs).  
- **General-Purpose Kinematics Solver:** Designed a solver for robots with arbitrary joint types and kinematic structures.  
- **Visual Servoing Initialization Tool:** Built an initialization tool to enhance the performance of visual servo control systems.  
- **Dual Robot Hand-Eye Calibration:** Created a calibration algorithm capable of simultaneously calibrating two collaborative robots.
